# Django comment Tag 
In Django templates, you can use the `{# #}` tag to add comments. Comments are ignored by the template engine and won't be rendered in the final output. They are useful for documenting your templates or temporarily disabling portions of code.

### Example:

```html
{# This is a comment #}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    {# This is another comment #}
    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <!-- This is an HTML comment, not a Django comment -->
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the lines containing `{# ... #}` are Django comments, and they won't be visible in the rendered HTML. They serve as notes or explanations for the template code.

### Multi-line Comments:

Django comments don't support multi-line comments in the same way as some programming languages. However, you can use multiple single-line comments to achieve a similar effect:

```html
{# This is
   a multi-line
   comment #}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    {# Another way to create multi-line comments
       is to use multiple single-line comments #}
    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### Comments for Debugging:

You can also use comments for debugging purposes, by commenting out parts of the code that you suspect might be causing issues, or to leave notes for yourself or other developers.

```html
{# Temporary comment to debug a specific section
   {% some_code_here %} #}
```

Just remember that Django comments are not processed by the template engine, so they won't affect the behavior of your template.

Keep in mind that Django comments are different from HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`). HTML comments are included in the final HTML output and can be seen in the browser's developer tools. Django comments are purely for template authoring and are not visible in the browser's rendering of the page.
